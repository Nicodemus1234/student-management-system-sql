Student Management System
Managing student records, enrollments, and academic performance has never been easier. This Student Management System is designed to keep everything structured, insightful, and efficient.

Overview
This SQL-based Student Management System helps institutions manage student details, course enrollments, instructor assignments, and performance tracking.

Description
This system follows relational database principles to ensure data integrity and efficient management. The key tables include:

Students – Stores student details

Instructors – Tracks faculty members

Courses – Contains course details

Enrollments – Links students to their registered courses and grades

Example Table Schema
sql
CREATE TABLE student_management.students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL
);
Insights
This system enables advanced data analysis using SQL queries to:

Identify student engagement trends

Evaluate course popularity

Analyze instructor workload

Track academic performance

Example Analytical Query
sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.first_name, s.last_name, AVG(
    CASE WHEN e.my_grade = 'A' THEN 4
         WHEN e.my_grade = 'B' THEN 3
         WHEN e.my_grade = 'C' THEN 2
         WHEN e.my_grade = 'D' THEN 1
         WHEN e.my_grade = 'F' THEN 0
         ELSE NULL
    END) AS average_grade
FROM student_management.students s  
JOIN student_management.enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id  
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.first_name, s.last_name;
