üß± Understanding the Database Structure
Core Tables & Relationships
The system consists of four main tables that work together for seamless academic management:

Table	Purpose
students	Stores student records (ID, name, email, date of birth)
instructors	Tracks instructor information
courses	Contains course details and assigned instructors
enrollments	Links students to courses, storing grades & registration dates
Database Integrity
Primary keys ensure uniqueness

Foreign keys establish relationships between tables

Cascading delete prevents orphan records

Indexes enhance query speed
